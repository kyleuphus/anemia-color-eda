# Anemia Color Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis of image-derived red, green, and blue pixel counts and hemoglobin levels with patient sex and anaemic status. Began as final project for Intro to Python for Data Science class, but I decided to flesh it out for a larger-scale project.


Data background:
    Higher red pixel intensity is associated with higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels and lower likelihood of anemia, while higher green pixel intensity is associated with lower Hb levels and a higher likelihood, and blue pixel intensity has little to no correlation.
